# aws-restart-labs
Labs completed using AWS Cloud9 through Vocareum (AWS re/Start)
For my first lab in the intro to Python, I created a GitHub repository. Inside this folder, I included the following:
hello-world.py: A simple Python script that prints "Hello, World". This is my first hands-on experience writing and running Python code in AWS Cloud9.
screenshot.png: A screenshot showing the successful execution of the script in the Cloud9 terminal.
README.md: A summary of the lab, what I worked on, and what I learned from the experience.

This structure allows me to clearly present my work and progress in the AWS re/Start program.  I will continue organizing future labs in the same way to build a clean and professional portfolio
